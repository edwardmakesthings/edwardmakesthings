Software Engineer & Technical Director | Building bridges between creative and technical worlds

Previously worked as a Pipeline TD in VFX/film building tools, pipelines, and APIs to give artists fewer headaches while building better assets.

## About Me

From designing jewelry to building Python APIs and React interfaces... I didn't take the short path to becoming a software engineer. My background spans creative disciplines and technical implementation, giving me a unique perspective on problem-solving.

## Current Focus

- 🔨 Building [OmniUI](https://github.com/edwardmakesthings/OmniUI) - A flexible widget system bridging desktop and web interfaces
- 🎨 Developing elegant software architecture with an emphasis on developer experience
- 🌐 Redesigning my [portfolio website](https://www.jaworenko.design/) using React, TypeScript, Next.js, Three.js, and Tailwind CSS
- 👨‍🏫 Sharing knowledge about scripting and art with Houdini

## What I Bring to the Table

- 🔄 Bridging technical and creative domains
- 🧩 Creating intuitive APIs and developer tools
- 🔍 Finding connections others miss 
- 🛠️ Building systems that make complex workflows feel intuitive
- 💡 Applying cross-disciplinary thinking to technical challenges

## Fun Facts

- I've been known to design 3D printers for fun (Learning a bit about mechanical engineering in the process). 
- My technical journey started at an art school, not a CS program
- Playing Vintage Story with my partner is one of my favorite pastimes.
